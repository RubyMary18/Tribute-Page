          <p>Claude Elwood Shannon is considered as the founding father of electronic communications age. He is an American mathematical engineer, whose work on technical and engineering problems within the communications industry, laying the groundwork for both the computer industry and telecommunications.</p>
          <hr class="style1">
          <em><h5>Childhood</h5></em>
          <p class="para1">Shannon was born in Petoskey, Michigan and grew up in Gaylord, Michigan. His father, Claude, Sr. (1862–1934), a descendant of early settlers of New Jersey, was a self-made businessman, and for a while, a Judge of Probate. Shannon's mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1890–1945), was a language teacher, and also served as the principal of Gaylord High School.</p>
<p class="para1">Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932.His best subjects were science and mathematics.</p>
<p class="para1">His childhood hero was Thomas Edison, who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.</p>
          <hr class="style1">
           <em><h5>Education</h5></em>
          <p class="para1">Shannon was educated at Michigan University in 1936, where he earned his B.S. degree. Later he went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied both electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving a master's degree and a doctorate. </p>
          <p class="para1">For his master's degree in electrical engineering, he applied George Boole's logical algebra to the problem of electrical switching. During that time Boole's system for logically manipulating 0 and 1 was little known, but it is now the nervous system of every computer in the world.</p>
          <p class="para1">Then for his doctorate, he applied mathematics to genetics. Shannon received both his master's degree and his doctorate in 1940.</p>

          <em><h5>Inventions</h5></em>
          <ul class="bull">
            <li class="bull1">Roman numeral computer called THROBAC
            <li class="bull1">Jugglin Machines</li>
            <li class="bull1">Flame throwing trumpet</li>
          <li class="bull1">One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the "Ultimate Machine", based on an idea by Marvin Minsky. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box. In addition</li>
            <li class="bull1">Device to solve Rubik's Cube puzzle</li>
            <li class="bull1">Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961</li>
